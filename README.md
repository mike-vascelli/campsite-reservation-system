# Campsite Reservation System
A spring boot application that provides REST APIs that will manage a campsite reservations


### To streamline the reservations a few constraints need to be in place
- The campsite will be free for all.
- The campsite can be reserved for max 3 days.
- The campsite can be reserved minimum 1 day(s) ahead of arrival and up to 1 month in advance.
- Reservations can be cancelled anytime.
- For sake of simplicity assume the check-in & check-out time is 12:00 AM

### System Requirements
- The users will need to find out when the campsite is available. So the system should expose an API to provide information of the
availability of the campsite for a given date range with the default being 1 month.
- Provide an end point for reserving the campsite. The user will provide his/her email & full name at the time of reserving the campsite
along with intended arrival date and departure date. Return a unique booking identifier back to the caller if the reservation is successful.
- The unique booking identifier can be used to modify or cancel the reservation later on. Provide appropriate end point(s) to allow
modification/cancellation of an existing reservation
- Due to the popularity of the island, there is a high likelihood of multiple users attempting to reserve the campsite for the same/overlapping
date(s). Demonstrate with appropriate test cases that the system can gracefully handle concurrent requests to reserve the campsite.
- Provide appropriate error messages to the caller to indicate the error cases.
- In general, the system should be able to handle large volume of requests for getting the campsite availability.
- There are no restrictions on how reservations are stored as as long as system constraints are not violated.

### Implementation Details
- The application is configured to use a Postgres DB.
- The system handles concurrent reservation requests by taking advantage of the unique constraint on the `day` column
in the `ReservedDay` table. This index guarantees that there can only be at most one record per each reserved day.
